v	Create HUD (below player: life/shurikens/smokebomb)(valueChanged, maxValue, timetoCharge) (Interface. Abstract factory?)
v	Scenery handle deadly obstacles (v to have THE background) (as many textures as wanted) (add scene boundaries) Background refactoring (to have Foreground objects)(regenerateInterval...) (as many textures as wanted)

ShurikenBomb
RayCastAnythingBut....

RoundPropertiesState (given to RoundGameStateConstructos. Has: deathmatch or teammatch, numMaxShurikens, maxTime, itemsAvailable, friendlyFire, scene, goalScore...)

?? StateFile refactoring (enable and disable animations at runtime) AnimationFile refactoring
?? SmokeBomb refactoring (real particles system)


Think about what to do: action+wallgrab; action+ducking
SmokeBomb as shader (that's harder than what I thought)
