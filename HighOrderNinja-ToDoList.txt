v	Projectile aimer refactoring (bug fixing). It aims even when there is a obstacle among
v	GameObject has list of collidables and drawables (CompositorDrawable?)(CompositorCollidable?)
v	Aimer aims worse when target is inside a smokebomb area
v	GameHero receives GameHeroProperties(?) {Color, input, ID, initial position...} at constructor
v	SmokeBomb (player colloring)
v	Team class (Color, playersMask, enemiesMask, numPlayers, totalPoints, gameHeroPropertiesList)
v	Get category from filter (one enumeration)
v	Scenery (http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/) (http://akinuri.deviantart.com/art/Metal-Textures-221702846)(http://miss-marlies.deviantart.com/art/Textures-dirt-grass-sand-and-water-335479475)

t	Invencibility during some states (sliding, diving, spining)
t	Player dies (DeadState/AirDeadState/ DieAction) when has no life


Identify body part hit by shuriken

ShurikenBomb
RayCastAnythingBut....

RoundPropertiesState (given to RoundGameStateConstructos. Has: deathmatch or teammatch, numMaxShurikens, maxTime, itemsAvailable, friendlyFire, scene, goalScore...)
Every GameHero object instantiates it's own frag statistics... At the end of each round, that fragStatistics is read by the team...
FragStatistics: totalShoots, deaths, kills, suicides

?? StateFile refactoring (enable and disable animations at runtime) AnimationFile refactoring
?? SmokeBomb refactoring (real particles system)

Jump towards collision normal

Think about what to do: action+wallgrab; action+ducking


ProjectileAimer works with priority queue (shurikens aim at player>items?)(aims calculates target velocity!!!)
Add life regeneration value (xml) to lifeItem

SmokeBomb as shader (that's harder than what I thought)

-	NinjaRope
	v After hook attachement
	- Before hook attachement
	- Shuriken cuts the rope
